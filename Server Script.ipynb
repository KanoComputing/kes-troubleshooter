    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The DynamoDB database should have the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id` (int): primary key created from the database\n",
    "- `session_id` (string): hash created for each session in the front-end\n",
    "- `answers` (serialized json): json from the app\n",
    "- `resolved` (boolean): boolean storing whether the solution resolved the issue for that customer\n",
    "- `jira_key` (string): key from the jira\n",
    "- `zendesk_ticket_id` (int): id of the Zendesk ticket created for the troubleshooter\n",
    "- `updated` (timestamp): time when the row was last updated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an overview of the data flow for the troubleshooter.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User arrives at troubleshooter. Unique `session_id` is created.\n",
    "2. When user answers a question, a list of all their answers is sent to the lambda.\n",
    "3. The lambda creates a row for the session, and stores the latest `answers` it has received\n",
    "4. When the user reaches a terminal node in the tree, then the lambda stores the `jira_key` of the known issue in the database\n",
    "5. If the user says that the solution provided did not resolve the problem, then the lambda takes the data and creates a Zendesk ticket, storing the resulting ticket id in `zendesk_ticket_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 1: Issue Not Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial JSON responses when the issue has **not yet been identified** will have `jira_key`, `resolved`, and `email` set to `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"session_id\": \"89d98eee66a278bb34d7bf548f23d7e9\",\n",
    "    \"jira_key\": null,\n",

    "    \"email\": null,\n",
    "    \"answers\": [ { \"question\": \"Is the sky blue?\", \"answer\": \"Yes\" } ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 2: Issue Identified + Not Sure If Resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "When the issue has been identified, the `jira_key` will have a value. At this stage the user will be asked whether the workaround provided has solved the issue for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"session_id\": \"89d98eee66a278bb34d7bf548f23d7e9\",\n",
    "    \"jira_key\": \"OS-1234\",\n",
    "    \"resolved\": null,\n",
    "    \"email\": null,\n",
    "    \"answers\": [ { \"question\": \"Is the sky blue?\", \"answer\": \"Yes\" }, { \"question\": \"What is the meaning of life?\", \"answer\": \"No\" ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 3: Issue Identified + Resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user responds that the workaround did resolve the issue, then the issue is marked as **resolved**. There is no email provided because we don't need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"session_id\": \"89d98eee66a278bb34d7bf548f23d7e9\",\n",
    "    \"jira_key\": \"OS-1234\",\n",
    "    \"resolved\": true,\n",
    "    \"email\": null,\n",
    "    \"answers\": [ { \"question\": \"Is the sky blue?\", \"answer\": \"Yes\" }, { \"question\": \"What is the meaning of life?\", \"answer\": \"No\" ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 4: Issue Identified + Not Resolved --> Create ZenDesk Ticket\n",
    "\n",
    "Final JSON response which will trigger a Zendesk ticket to be created\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"session_id\": \"89d98eee66a278bb34d7bf548f23d7e9\",\n",
    "    \"jira_key\": \"OS-1234\",\n",
